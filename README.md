  - 12V LiPo battery powers motors and motor drivers.  
  - Power bank supplies Raspberry Pi, Teensy microcontroller, and IMU.  
- **Control System**:  
  - Raspberry Pi 4 handles high-level planning (ROS).  
  - Teensy manages low-level PID control for motors.  
- **Sensors**:  
  - Encoders provide wheel odometry feedback.
  - Encoders and IMU data are fused using EKF for localization. 
  - LiDAR is used for scan matching for AMCL.

## üåç Environmental Setup  
The testing environment simulates dynamic indoor scenarios with static and moving obstacles:  
- **Start Point**: Blue **X** marks the robot‚Äôs initial position.  
- **Goal Points**: Red locations represent target destinations for navigation tests.  
- **Obstacles**:  
  - **Dynamic** (yellow circles): Moving objects.  
  - **Static** (grey squares): Fixed barriers.

## üìà Performance Evaluation  
Planners were tested in real-world conditions across several metrics:  
- **Planning Time**: Fastest with Optimized RRT (~0.012s)  
- **Execution Time**: Best balance achieved by A* + DWA (~34‚Äì36s)  
- **Path Smoothness**: Higher with TEB, especially in narrow/dynamic areas  
- **Memory Usage**: Lowest with Optimized RRT (~62MB)  
- **Distance to Goal**: Shortest with Dijkstra (~10.4m), A* comparable (~11m)
